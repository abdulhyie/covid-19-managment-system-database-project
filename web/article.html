            <h1>COVID'19</h1>
            <p>
                Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family and appear just like spiked
                rings when observed through an electron microscope. The surface looks with various 
                spikes, which are helpful to attack and bind living cells. These are the viruses causing the
                simple common cold disease to severe illnesses like
                Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), 
                Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The source of 
                these viruses is some animals including bats. The word coronavirus 
                is a derivative of the Latin corona, which means crown or halo, that states to the typical
                look indicative of a crown or a solar corona around the virions.
